python problems:
1. Write a program that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. 
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. 
For example, say I type the string:

My name is Steven

Then I would see the string:

Steven is name My

shown back to me.

2. Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, 
then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. 
Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
